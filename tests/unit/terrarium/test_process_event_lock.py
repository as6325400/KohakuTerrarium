"""Regression tests for the ``_process_event`` lock (bug #2).

Pre-fix, ``Agent._process_event`` performed a sizeable block of side
effects BEFORE acquiring ``self._processing_lock``:

* turn / branch counter bookkeeping
* ``session_store.append_event`` (twice)
* ``output_router.on_user_input``  (TUI render path)
* ``plugins.notify("on_event", ...)``
* ``inject_skill_path_hint`` (mutates the agent's controller prompt)

When two trigger tasks called ``_process_event`` near-simultaneously,
all of the above would interleave between the two calls — the TUI
would mid-stream a second user bubble, the session log got
out-of-order events, and skill-hint mutation could race.

Post-fix the entire body is wrapped in the lock.  These tests verify:

1. Two concurrent ``_process_event`` calls serialize end-to-end —
   no overlap of pre-controller side effects.
2. The pre-controller side effects of the SECOND call only run AFTER
   the first call's controller stage completes.
